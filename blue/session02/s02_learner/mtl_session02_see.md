## Learning Objectives

1. Describe the decisions your team made in producing your team data table.

2. Test out whether your expectations about team historical trends are displayed in the "viz" tabs.

3. Apply your clinical expertise to identify new information about a team patient in the "data" tabs.


# In-session Exercise (30 minutes)

## *MTL* on BISL

### 1. Open Internet Explorer. Go to mtl.how/data. First select your VISN and then select your facility.
+ For best results, please use Internet Explorer or Edge. SharePoint is a Microsoft platform and works best with Microsoft web browsers.

[![](https://github.com/lzim/teampsd/blob/master/resources/gifs/mtl_2.0/data_ui_login.gif)](#DontLink) 

**_MTL_ 2.0. For _MTL_ 1.7, click [here](https://github.com/lzim/mtl/blob/master/release_1.7/mtl_session02_see.md)**


### 2. Explore the information available in the BISL SharePoint splash page.
[![](https://github.com/lzim/teampsd/blob/master/resources/gifs/mtl_2.0/data_ui_splashpage.gif)](#DontLink)

**_MTL_ 2.0. For _MTL_ 1.7, click [here](https://github.com/lzim/mtl/blob/master/release_1.7/mtl_session02_see.md)**

- Click on the View dropdown in the top right corner. What View options are there and what do they mean? Hints:
  - Count: Aggregate Data for Viz trends
  - Data: Sortable report of data
  - Diag: Diagnostic data 
  - Enc: Encounter types of visits
  - HF: Health Factors data related to visits
  - Meas: Measures or flag names
  - Viz: Visualization of trends  

- What filtering options are available? 
  - Filter to your clinic or division to see trends for the last two years.
  
#### New for _MTL_ 2.0
- You can now switch between View and filtering options via the dropdown menu in the top-right corner and grey buttons, instead of through the tabs on the Excel spreadsheet. We are no longer directly showing an Excel sheet on the splash page.

- There is no need to use the "Data > Refresh Connections" button anymore and it will not respond as the data pull and refresh workflow has changed. 

- vizDiag shows unique visits by primary diagnosis on the visit of PTSD, Dep, OUD, or AUD. 

- Patient SSID is no longer asterisked out in the splash page. It has been completely removed. Please go to the data UI to see Patient SSID information.

For *MTL* 1.7 click [here](https://github.com/lzim/mtl/blob/master/release_1.7/mtl_session02_see.md).

## Your Team Data Folder

### 3. Scroll to your team folder at the bottom of the page. Open the data_ui folder and open your data_ui file in Excel.
- Click on the data_ui file. This will show a preview in your Explorer or Edge browser window.
- Click on "Edit Workbook" dropdown at the top and then, "Edit in Excel."


[![](https://github.com/lzim/teampsd/blob/master/resources/gifs/mtl_2.0/edit_in_excel.gif)](#DontLink)

### 4. Go to the ClinicSelection tab. Use columns C-H to select the clinics that make up your team.
- You can sort and filter by Clinic Name, Division Name, Physical Location, Primary Stopcode, Secondary Stopcode, and Default Provider.
- Note: This will pull all clinics used in the last two years (including de-activated clinics: denoted by "ZZ"). For de-activated clinics, you can find the date of de-activation in column I.
- Follow the instructions in **Box A2.** 
- After filtering, click the "Add All" arrow in column B (Cell B6). Fine-tune your selections by double-clicking on the clinic name in column A (to remove) or column C (to add).

#### New for _MTL_ 2.0
- In the future, if you want to quickly get the same list of clinics again, you can select the grey "Get previous clinic list from last click of Get Patient-level Data" arrow in Column B (Cell B3).

For *MTL* 1.7 click [here](https://github.com/lzim/mtl/blob/master/release_1.7/mtl_session02_see.md).

### 5. To view your team patient data and your team trends click "Get Patient-level Data." We will not do this in-session today.
- **You already have a fresh data UI file to work with in your team data_ui folder.** 
- We will learn about the "Create Team Data Table" button in our next team meeting.

#### New for _MTL_ 2.0
- "Create Team Data Table for Sim UI" is now called "Create Team Data."

[![](https://github.com/lzim/teampsd/blob/master/resources/gifs/mtl_2.0/create_team_data_folder.png)](#DontLink)

For *MTL* 1.7 click [here](https://github.com/lzim/mtl/blob/master/release_1.7/mtl_session02_see.md).

### NOTE: It takes some time to run a query from your team data UI to the VA Corporate Data Warehouse. 
- On average (depending on the size of your team) it may take 15 minutes or so for your team data UI to pull in fresh data, and Microsoft Excel will be unresponsive until the data UI has finished pulling in your data.

**_MTL_ 2.0. For _MTL_ 1.7, click [here](https://github.com/lzim/mtl/blob/master/release_1.7/mtl_session02_see.md)**

### 6. Click to view the "viz" tab, which show team trends.
- There are team trends for diagnoses, encounters, health factor data (e.g., suicide plans, evidence-based practice templates), and measures from Mental Health Assistant.
- What stands out to you?
- What is most important to you to check out first?
- What is most surprising?

**_MTL_ 2.0. For _MTL_ 1.7, click [here](https://github.com/lzim/mtl/blob/master/release_1.7/mtl_session02_see.md)**

#### New for _MTL_ 2.0
- Click on any trend line and then "Quick Explore" (look for the magnifying glass). In the "Explore" box, pick the item you want to explore and click "Drill To." Keep using the Quick Explore to drill until you reach the data you want. To return to the original settings, click on the gray "Reset Pivot Chart."

- The viz tabs will also return to default selections, when you click "Get Patient-level Data" for new data pulls.

- Right click on a trend line and filter to hide a selected item or only keep the selected item.

- vizDiag in the data UI shows a drill down by diagnoses or combination of diagnoses.

[![](https://github.com/lzim/teampsd/blob/master/resources/gifs/mtl_2.0/session2_data_ui_4_viz_diag_mtl_2.0.gif)](#DontLink)

For *MTL* 1.7 click [here](https://github.com/lzim/mtl/blob/master/release_1.7/mtl_session02_see.md).

### 7. Click to view the "data" tab, which show your team's individual patient information.
- Patients who have requested restricted access to their information have asterisks (****) in Columns F & G. If you are a VA provider, you can still identify patients from Column H.
- Patient information corresponds to the same categories as the team trends: diagnoses, encounters, health factor data (e.g., suicide plans, evidence-based practice templates), and measures from Mental Health Assistant.
- Providers can filter to find specific patients, or produce reports. 

#### New for _MTL_ 2.0
- dataDiag in the data UI has an additional column after "Diagnoses of Interest," called "Primary Diagnoses", specifying which diagnosis is primary.

[![](https://github.com/lzim/teampsd/blob/master/resources/gifs/mtl_2.0/primary_diagnoses.png)](#DontLink)

For *MTL* 1.7 click [here](https://github.com/lzim/mtl/blob/master/release_1.7/mtl_session02_see.md).

- What **data** tab would you use to find out how many current patients on the team are engaged in a specific evidence-based psychotherapy? What column shows you the session number (EBP template) that the patient is on?
- What **viz** option would you use to see what the most common service encounters or visits are?
- Are there services that have been increasing over time? Are there services that have been decreasing over time?

## With the team trends (viz) and team patient (data) information in the data UI, your team can efficiently use team meetings to focus on the interrelated issues of care coordination and team quality improvement.
